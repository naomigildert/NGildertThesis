# NGildertThesis
Repository of code presented in my PhD Thesis: Combining Implicit and Explicit Communication In Object Manipulation Tasks Between Two Robots

The Repo contains all scene files from CoppeliaSim used for experimental results as described in the Thesis as well as any associated scripts used to generate environments.

CONTENTS:

Random Environment Generation:

- Python Script Randomly Generated Environments: genScenes.py

Coppelia Sim Environments:

Path Solution CSV Files:

- Simple Environment Path: SE_path1.csv
- Line Following Environment Path 1: LF_path1.csv
- Line Following Environment Path 2: LF_path2.csv
- Line Following Environment Path 3: LF_path3.csv
- Cluttered Environment Path 1: CE_path1.csv
- Cluttered Environment Path 2: CE_path2.csv
- Cluttered Environment Path 2: CE_path3.csv
- Randomly Generated Environment Path 1: RE_path1.csv
- Randomly Generated Environment Path 2: RE_path2.csv

Please note the controllers used in these environments and throughout all experiments in the thesis is the combined system. When comparing fully explicit to fully implicit the combined system is fully weighted one way or another, w=0 makes the system fully explicit and w=1 makes the system fully implicit
