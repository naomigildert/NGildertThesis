# NGildertThesis
Repository of code presented in my PhD Thesis: Combining Implicit and Explicit Communication In Object Manipulation Tasks Between Two Robots

The Repo contains all scene files from CoppeliaSim used for experimental results as described in the Thesis as well as any associated scripts used to generate environments.

Please note the controllers used in these environments and throughout all experiments in the thesis is the combined system. When comparing fully explicit to fully implicit the combined system is fully weighted one way or another, w=0 makes the system fully explicit and w=1 makes the system fully implicit
